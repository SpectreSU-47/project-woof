<h3>The Beagle is quite the interesting dog, while not my personal favorite, they do hold an interesting physique. Some examples of such characteristics would be: small, compact, and hardy. Canines in this dog breed are merry and fun loving, but being hounds, they can also be contrary and require patient and somewhat creative training techniques.</h3>
